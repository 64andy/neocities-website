__UNDER CONSTRUCTION__: This entire site is a WIP I might not finish

I tried to make a Web 1.0 style website, to prove that you don't need
constantly changing web frameworks, with slow bloated JS to make
things\...

\... unfortunately I'm using Jekyll, and also [Javascript](/9ufhdipklifwduhgsdaklfjko)\...

BUT HEY at least I've got no tracking cookies, and I have no newsletter

<script>
  function init() {
    typeOutText('#console-banner',
      {
        ms: 60,
        slowCoeff: 6,
        align: 'right',
        endWithCursor: true,
      })
  }

  window.onload = init
</script>
